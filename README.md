# Traffic-Light-Control-Method-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning.
The TLCM(Traffic Light Timer Control Method) project leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Zero-Shot Learning to enhance traffic light management at urban intersections. Traditional traffic light systems are often static and fail to adapt to real-time traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies and increased congestion. Our solution integrates DRL to dynamically adjust green-light timings based on live traffic data and Zero-Shot Learning to handle varying real-time traffic patterns. By implementing this system, we aim to significantly reduce traffic delays and optimize traffic flow. The system is implemented using vehicle detection and tracking with deep neural networks, coupled with traffic modelling and DRL for adaptive timing adjustments.
